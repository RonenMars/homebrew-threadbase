      Next steps to finish setup:

        1. Set your API key (one-time):
           tb-streamer set-key <YOUR_API_KEY>

        2. Start the service (also starts on login):
           brew services start tb-streamer

        3. To update later:
           brew upgrade tb-streamer

      Note: Homebrew install is mutually exclusive with the
      manual scripts/deploy.sh install. If you previously
      installed via that path, run:
        launchctl bootout gui/$UID/com.ronen.threadbase
      before starting the Homebrew service.
